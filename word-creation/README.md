# Word Game

This is my first project in React!

This repository consists of code for a website which shuffles six letters, and the user has to find as many English subwords inside of it within the time limit.
A six letter word is always guaranteed. The words of at most six letters were taken from the repo [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

## ToDo
- Allow users to register and save their previous letters and scores.
- Allow users to try with a letter selection again.
- Store words in a database and determine the most commonly found words.
